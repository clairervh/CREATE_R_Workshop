# Your original mission {#mission}

The data file `Fundybirds.csv` contains data on bird species counted in Fundy National Park during the Audubon Society's annual [Christmas Bird Count](http://www.audubon.org/conservation/science/christmas-bird-count).  Your goal is to write a new R script that does a basic analysis of these data.  

Be sure to begin the script with commented lines with the file name, your name, the date, and a description of the script, and also comment liberally throughout the script to indicate what your code does!

Your script should do the following:

* Read in the file `Fundybirds.csv`

* Look at the structure of the data

* Create data frames that answer the following questions: (Hint: Use `dplyr` functions!)

	+ How many times was each type of bird counted?
	
	+ Which birds were counted more than 10 times?

* Make a table that shows how many species were counted each hour

* Plot this table using a barplot

## This script analyzes bird count data from the 2015 Audubon Society Christmas Bird Count.
## It assesses the number of times that each type of bird was counted, as well as how many were counted each hour.
##

## Load required packages
	library(dplyr)

# Read in the file
	Fundybirds <- read.csv(file="~/Documents/R/CREATE_R_Workshop/Data/Fundybirds.csv")

# Look at the structure
	str(Fundybirds)

# How many times was each bird counted, and which birds were counted more than 10 times?
	Fundybirds %>% group_by(CommonName) %>% summarize(Count=length(CommonName))
	Fundybirds %>% group_by(CommonName) %>% summarize(Count=length(CommonName)) %>% filter(Count>10)

# How many birds were counted in each hour?  Make a table and a barplot.
	Fundybirds$Hour %>% table
	Fundybirds$Hour %>% table %>% barplot(las=1, ylab="Count", xlab="Hour")
```
