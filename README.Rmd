Introduction to R for Ecological Data Analysis is a 2-day workshop at the University of New Brunswick taught by [Dr. Lindsay Brin](http://www.lindsaydbrin.com). This workshop is part of the [Watershed and Aquatics Training in Environmental Research (WATER)](http://canadianriversinstitute.com/training/water-program/) program at the [Canadian Rivers Institute](http://canadianriversinstitute.com), funded by an NSERC Collaborative Research and Training Experience (CREATE) grant. 

An outline of the workshop content, which includes lessons based on Data Carpentry materials as well as lessons that I developed, can be found in [Lessons_Outline.html](http://lindsaydbrin.github.io/CREATE_R_Workshop/Lessons_Outline.html).
