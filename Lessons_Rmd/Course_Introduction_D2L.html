<h1>Course overview</h1>
<p><strong>Welcome to Introduction to R for Ecological Data Analysis!</strong></p>
<p>R is a powerful, free, open-source, and widely used tool for working with data that can allow you to streamline your analysis process, increase reproducibility, catch and avoid mistakes, and access newly developed analyses and statistical approaches.</p>
<p>This course will provide you with the tools for reading in, manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing data in R. For example, we will cover topics such as cleaning and organizing data, joining data sets, working with factors, writing functions, using for loops and if…else statements, etc.</p>
<hr />

<div id="learning-objectives" class="section level1">
<h1>Learning objectives</h1>
<p>By the end of this course, our goal is that you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gain a conceptual understanding of how R works</li>
<li>Be aware of the availability of relevant packages to expand R’s functionality</li>
<li>Be able to use R as a calculator and basic data manipulation tool</li>
<li>Be able to write simple functions in R to automate analyses</li>
<li>Be able to produce useful graphical and numeric summaries of data</li>
<li>Be able to implement basic statistical tests (ANOVA, linear regression)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
</div>
<div id="course-instructions" class="section level1">
<h1>Course instructions</h1>
<p>As you go through the lessons, please work through all presented code on your own. This will give you practice writing code, and hone your troubleshooting skills when things don’t work. (The number one reason for things not working is a typo - often a misspelling or dropped parentheses or quotation marks!)</p>
<p>Challenges are presented at the end of sections, often in the middle of a larger lesson, and are numbered within each lesson. Please work through challenges as you reach them; this will help you practice and better understand concepts before building upon them. The course structure is meant to be interactive in that way, and will be more effective if you approach it as such.</p>
<p>For all challenges, please submit a document with your code as well as your output (text and/or plots). You can use any application to compile this info (e.g., Word, Pages, etc.), but please convert your documents to pdf if possible, to allow for easier viewing on all machines. Be sure to specify the lesson as well as the challenge number for each answer.</p>

</div>
<div id="why-will-this-course-be-helpful-to-me" class="section level1">
<h1>Why will this course be helpful to me?</h1>
<p>The focus of the course will be on skills for working with data in R that will make analysis easier, more efficient, and more reproducible, saving you time and headaches before you even get to the point of running statistics.</p>
<p>For example, if you have data from two analyses using the same samples, you can use one line of code in R to join the data sets based on a sample ID, and not worry about making copy and paste mistakes in Excel. Or, if you want to run the same analyses on data sets from two different years, you can avoid doing the work twice by writing a function to do the analysis, and then use one line of code to apply it to each dataset. And, when you get your second year of data, you can avoid staring at a spreadsheet and trying desperately to remember how you did the analysis the first time.</p>
<p>We will also cover topics on what to do once your data has been wrangled: implementing basic statistics, plotting, and automatically outputting pdf files of beautifully formatted plots that will not need to be touched up in Illustrator or Paint.</p>
